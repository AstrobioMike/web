# In a nutshell

Anvi'o is an analysis and visualization platform for 'omics data.

Please find the **methods paper** here: [https://peerj.com/articles/1319/](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/) 

Anvi'o would not have been possible without the help of many people who directly or indirectly contributed to its development. Here is the acknowledgements section of our [methods paper](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/), where we had the chance to name some of the individuals who helped us:
