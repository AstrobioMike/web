>(coming soon)

## Oligotyping

><a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/oligotyping/">Oligotyping</a> is a computational method that aims to be useful in the domain of microbial ecology to answer some specific questions. The method makes it possible to decompose very closely related taxa based on high-throughput sequencing analysis of phylogenetically informative genes amplified from environmental samples (such as 16S rRNA gene). See the <a href="{{ site.url  }}/projects/oligotyping/">project page</a>.

## Minimum Entropy Decomposition

><a href="{{ site.url }}/projects/med/">MED</a> is a novel, information theory-based clustering algorithm for sensitive partitioning of high-throughput marker gene sequences. The source code is distributed through the oligotyping pipeline. See the <a href="{{ site.url  }}/projects/med/">project page</a>

## Illumina Utilities Library

>A lightweighted and high-performance library to analyze raw Illumina data. It contains programs for demultiplexing, quality filtering, and mergeing partially or fully overlapping reads. Illumina utils has been a core component of the sequencing operations at the MBL. The source code, installation instructions and examples are available through its GitHub repository: [https://github.com/meren/illumina-utils](https://github.com/meren/illumina-utils)

## BLAST Filtering Pipeline

>A metagenomic short read filtering software that uses a flexible configuration format. It allows users to define a chain of genomic filters, each of which perform on the output data provided by the previous filter, to filter reads out from sequencing data. It can exploit Sun Grid Engine and distribute individual processes. The source code is available through its GitHub repository: [https://github.com/meren/BLAST-filtering-pipeline](https://github.com/meren/BLAST-filtering-pipeline)
