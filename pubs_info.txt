10.1101/090993	An FMT study with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Bacteroidales: high-colonization rate, Clostridiales: low colonization rate.; Colonization success is negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation.; MAGs with the same taxonomy showed different colonization properties, highlighting the limitation of low-resolution approaches.	https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CytPL3kVIAA-UJX.jpg
