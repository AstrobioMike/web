This article describes some recipes to install software written by other groups.

Most software we rely on to enhance anvi'o's abilities *do* allow us to re-distribute their code, or have them pre-installed, however, we do not want to follow that route. Although doing that would have made your life much easier, internalizing third-party software from within other platforms directly makes users unable to appreciate other groups' efforts.

As an apology, we will do our best to keep this article up-to-date, so installing third-party software anvi'o uses will not be a big hassle for you. Thank you for your understanding, and your patience in advance.

## Centrifuge

[Centrifuge](http://www.ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/) is a classification engine that enables rapid, accurate and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species on desktop computers.

To install centrifuge, you need to first decide where you want to put all its files on your disk. It could be a directory under `/opt`, or `/usr/local`, or somewhere under your user directory if you don't have superuser access on the machine you are working on. Once you know where to keep it, open a terminal and start with this, after replacing the path with the correct one:

{% highlight bash %}
$ export CENTRIFUGE="/path/to/a/directory"
{% endhighlight %}

You *should* also put this line in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make sure it is set in your environment everytime you start a new terminal.

Then you will get the code, and compile it:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd $CENTFIGURE
$ git clone https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge
$ cd centrifuge && make
{% endhighlight %}

This compiles everything, but does not install anything. To make sure binary files are available directly, you can run this (and again, you should add this line into your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make sure every new terminal session remembers where they are):

{% highlight bash %}
$ export PATH=$PATH:$CENTRIFUGE/centrifuge
{% endhighlight %}

If everything is alright so far, this is what you should see if you run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ centrifuge --version | head -n 1
centrifuge-class version v1.0.1-beta-27-g30e3f06ec3
{% endhighlight %}

Good? Good.

Next, you will need to download pre-computed indexes (unless you want to go Voldemort and compile your own indexes). The compressed indexes for Bacteria, Viruses, Human genome is 6.3 Gb, and it will take about 9 Gb on your disk uncompressed. You will download these only for once:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd $CENTRIFUGE
$ wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/centrifuge/data/b+h+v.tar.gz
$ tar -zxvf b+h+v.tar.gz && rm -rf b+h+v.tar.gz
$ centrifuge-inspect --name-table $CENTRIFUGE/b+h+v/b+h+v > b+h+v-names-table.txt
{% endhighlight %}

The following command will make sure you have the necessary conversion table ready for anvi'o when the time comes. This is also something you will have to do only once:

{% highlight bash %}
$ centrifuge-inspect --name-table $CENTRIFUGE/b+h+v/b+h+v > $CENTRIFUGE/b+h+v-names-table.txt
{% endhighlight %}

If everything went alright, you should see something like this when you run the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ wc -l $CENTRIFUGE/b+h+v-names-table.txt
   13455 $CENTRIFUGE/b+h+v-names-table.txt
{% endhighlight %}

See? You are totally doing this!
