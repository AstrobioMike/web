You can install the new version, or upgrade your existing installation, using one of these methods:

<a href="http://merenlab.org/2015/05/01/installation/">Installing via PyPi</a> | <a href="http://merenlab.org/2015/08/20/installation-on-mac/">OS X installer</a> | <a href="http://merenlab.org/2015/08/22/docker-image-for-anvio/">Docker image</a>

The following sections are from the [release notes](https://github.com/meren/anvio/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

## A new anvi'o database: 'Samples Information'

The purpose of this new database is to store information about samples (see <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/110" class="issue-link" title="Samples information infrastructure">#110</a>). Initially it leverages anvi'o's ability to do more powerful visualizations, but in the long run it is going to be the basis of helpful statistical analyses. Here is how this feature looks like on the infant gut dataset with a mock samples information data (also please note the new title (<a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/commit/3c7935efe2935493e6b445857e4f45685b0ffdf1" class="commit-link">3c7935e</a>), and neatly organized labels for categorical values underneath the tree):

</div>

## Other important changes


We stopped using the word "metadata" in the codebase (see <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/194" class="issue-link" title='Better terminology for "metadata" instances in the code, and in command line clients'>#194</a>). We now follow the "everything is data" principle, and we are less lazy and explicit about what kind of data they are.

We had a major change in our database terminology as well: starting with this version, anvi'o's <strong>'annotation database'</strong> will be known as <strong>'contigs database'</strong> (see <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/198" class="issue-link" title="ANNOTATION.db --&gt; CONTIGS.db">#198</a>).

<a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/tree/master/sandbox">Sandbox</a> directory in the codebase contains ad hoc scripts that are not fancy enough to be in the anvi'o distribution. However, from now on they will be installed on your system. If you type <code>anvi-script-</code>, and then press <code>TAB</code> key twice, you can see a list of all scripts.

<code>anvi-gen-variability-profile</code> has now a new parameter, <code>—min-coverage-in-each-sample</code>, which allows the user to define a coverage value of <code>X</code> in order to make sure all final variable nucleotide positions are covered at least <code>X</code> times in each sample (see <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/196" class="issue-link" title="control for minimum split position coverages when creating variability profiles">#196</a>). You can find more information on <code>anvi-gen-variability-profile</code> here: <a href="http://merenlab.org/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/">http://merenlab.org/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/</a>

We changed the underlying design of our command line client user interfaces (<a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/commit/ef78ee43dcf5240bcf789fdec86a16f680a290db" class="commit-link">ef78ee4</a>). These changes are largely seamless to the user, however, some parameters are not the same anymore. Please re-run your batch scripts, if you have any, to make sure you have the correct parameters after upgrading your databases.

## Database upgrade homeworks for long term anvi'o users: <em>Booo!</em>

Yes, sorry! If you have been using anvi'o and if you are upgrading it from the previous version, there are multiple things you will need to do:

<ul>
<li>Convert your existing 'annotation databases' into 'contigs databases' using <code>anvi-script-convert-annotation-db-to-contigs-db</code>, and don't forget to rename them if they are called 'ANNOTATION.db' just so you remember later.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade your existing contigs database (which you just converted from an annotation database) from the previous version 2 to the new version 3 using <code>anvi-script-upgrade-contigs-db-v2-to-v3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Upgrade your existing profile database from the previous version 5 to the new version 6 using <code>anvi-script-upgrade-profile-db-v5-to-v6</code>.</li>
</ul>

Anvi’o developers apologize profusely for all the inconvenience, and they promise that this was the last change at this magnitude (furthermore, they agree to toss <a href="https://github.com/ozcanesen" class="user-mention">@ozcanesen</a> into a volcano as a sacrifice for forgiveness if they fail to keep this very promise).
