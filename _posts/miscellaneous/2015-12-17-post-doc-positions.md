{:.notice}
One of these positions is now filled, and we are now interested in a computational scientist!

There are multiple post-doc positions available in our new lab at the Department of Medicine to study
the ecology of gut microbes and their interactions with their hosts. Areas of focus include, but are not
limited to, the early colonization of the human gut, elucidating the role of the adult microbiome in
inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, and targeted enrichment of the microbiome.
Positions are available to start immediately.

## The Lab

Although we have a strong interest in the human microbiome and public health, we work with a wide range of environments, including oceans, terrestrial habitats, and urban sewage systems, to accomplish our overarching goal: understanding the microbial life, their ecology, and their impact on the ecosystem functioning.Our lab develops novel computational approaches and advanced visualization strategies to analyze high-throughput sequencing data of marker gene amplicons, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes that can detect and characterize changes in microbial communities from subtle nucleotide variations to pangenomes. Besides our computational expertise, we have a strong interest in hypothesis generation and thorough experimental validation.The lab has access to germ-free mice facilities, medical and environmental samples, the latest high-throughput sequencing technologies, cutting-edge computational resources, and a group of established and experienced scientists who appreciate the importance of collaborative research and interaction. Our lab is located in The Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a modern 10-story research facility for medical, genomic, and systems biology research, at the University of Chicago campus.

## Application Requirements

We are striving to create an interdisciplinary team in our new lab, and will consider applications from post-doctoral candidates with any background, as long as they have a strong interest in microbial ecology. That being said, microbiologists who are interested in bioinformatics, and individuals with computational and/or statistics backgrounds with strong interest in biology are likely to be better fit for our group.
