I am very happy to announce that I will be serving the Marine Biological Laboratory as an [MBL Fellow](http://www.mbl.edu/research/mbl-fellows/a-murat-eren/) for the next four years.

The MBL is definitely where my affection for microbial life got solidified, but my interest in microbial ecology started just a little before I arrived to the MBL in 2011 as a postdoctoral scientist to work with Mitch Sogin (who was an amazing mentor, and the older I get, the more I appreciate what he did for me).

In 2010 I was a PhD student in New Orleans and has been wandering through various territories of computation almost randomly. When I serendipitously run into [Mike Ferris](https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/microbiology/faculty_detail.aspx?name=ferris_michael), I was ready to move on to a completely different field to spend yet another year or two. Mike accepted me in his lab, introduced me to microbial ecology, and gave me a [dataset](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026732) to play with while he guided me through general concepts of microbiology patiently. What Mike did for me in his lab at the Children's Hospital was already more than what I could ask for. But he also included me in some *extracurricular* activities, which eventually made me realize that I really really liked microbes and ecology.

When the oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 reached to the shores of Louisiana, I had just recently started to work with Mike and his group. One day they were going out for a little expedition around the salt marshes of the Mississippi delta to collect samples, and they brought me along despite the fact that I had nothing to offer: my fragile computer fingers that were utterly useless in the lab bench had also no experience sampling the environment. So I was more of a liability than help. But there I was looking at them work.

There is a plethora of literature on microbes and ecology, but seeing the care of a microbial ecologist attending to a challenged environment gave me the ultimate understanding of what I have been missing in my life. I was officially a computer scientist, but this little trip was one of the events in Mike's lab that made me slowly realize that I no longer wanted to be just a computer scientist, and I thank him for that. Maybe this is exactly what some computer people need: to be included in things even if there is no obvious reason for them to be included. Because no one really knows what one is looking for.

Then I was done with the graduate school, and was at the MBL. I can never thank enough to the year-round scientists of the MBL and Bay Paul Center, especially Mitch Sogin and Hilary Morrison, for being very patient with me while helping me develop a broader understanding of things that I had just started to enjoy.

As I mentioned in [my profile](http://www.mbl.edu/research/mbl-fellows/a-murat-eren/), I am looking forward to continue taking part in the MBL's dynamic and inspiring community, and contribute as best as I can to its mission of excellence in science and education in the next four years, and likely even after that.

Here are three photographs I took during one of the snow storms of 2015:

Yes, Woods Hole is beautiful year-round!
